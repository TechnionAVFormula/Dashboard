# Perception Dashboard 

## Description
#### 
This repo supports perception's dashboard, developed in Plotly. 
The dashboard shows two images of the same frame, side by side. It enables to add a different feature to each image (e.g. left image with bounding boxes, right image with xyz coordinates) for comparision. 
The dashboard offers a visual tool for debugging our performances in a frame-by-frame fashion.
